## AI-Based Robo Dog – Software Prototype

This repository contains an initial working **software-level prototype** for an AI-based robotic dog designed for surveillance and assistance tasks.

---

## Problem Context

The project addresses the need for an intelligent robotic system that can:
- Visualize surroundings
- Respond to voice commands
- Detect abnormal situations such as unusual silence or absence of movement
- Assist in security, monitoring, and safety-critical environments

---

## Current Implementation

- Implemented using **Python**
- Simulates basic robotic dog behavior
- Includes motion detection logic and response actions
- Demonstrates AI-based decision flow at a software level
- Represents a functional **early-stage working prototype**

---

## Special Intelligence Concept: Absence & Silence Intelligence

The proposed system introduces **Absence & Silence Intelligence**, an AI-based behavioral logic where the robotic dog detects abnormal conditions such as:

- Prolonged absence of movement in monitored areas
- Unusual silence where sound activity is normally expected

Based on these conditions, the system can:
- Identify potential security or safety risks
- Trigger autonomous inspection or alert behaviors
- Support surveillance and monitoring applications

This intelligence is implemented through sensor data analysis and AI-driven decision-making logic.

## Planned Enhancements

- Computer vision using **OpenCV**
- AI-based decision-making using **TensorFlow**
- Integration with sensors (camera, microphone, motion)
- Embedded controller and wireless communication module
- Physical robotic dog hardware integration
- Advanced autonomous navigation and response behaviors

---

## Technology Stack (Planned)

- Programming Language: **Python**
- Frameworks: **OpenCV, TensorFlow**
- Sensors: Camera, Microphone, Motion Sensors
- Communication: Wireless modules
- Control System: Embedded controller

## Note

This repository represents an **early-stage prototype focusing on software logic**.  
Hardware implementation and full real-world deployment will be carried out in future development phases.
