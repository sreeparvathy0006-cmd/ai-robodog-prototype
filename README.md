## AI-Based Robo Dog – Software Prototype

This repository contains an initial **working software prototype** for an AI-based robotic dog.

### Current Implementation
- Implemented using **Python**
- Simulates basic robotic dog behavior
- Includes motion detection logic and response actions
- Represents a functional software-level prototype

### Planned Enhancements
- Computer vision using OpenCV
- AI-based decision-making using TensorFlow
- Integration with sensors (camera, microphone, motion)
- Embedded controller and wireless communication
- Physical robotic dog hardware integration

### Note
This is an early-stage prototype focusing on software logic.
Hardware implementation will be carried out in the next development phase.
